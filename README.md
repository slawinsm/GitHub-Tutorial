# GitHub-Tutorial
 This is a repository for the RLadies Getting Around GitHub Tutorial.
 
 In the tutorial we go over set up, configuration and an introduction to Git, GitHub and RStudio. I created this tutorial as I was learning Git and GitHub. It is meant to be from one new user to another. 

 If you would like to follow along, take a look at the rmarkdown file in this repository or navigate [here](https://rpubs.com/slawinsm/GettingAroundGitHub). We also move to the RLadies of Gainesville [practice repository](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/practice) for the interactive tutorial where we go over how to fork a repository, clone to GitHub Desktop, make changes, push those changes and create a pull request.
