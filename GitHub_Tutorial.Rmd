Git.. GitHub.. What are they? Why do they matter? In this tutorial we will introduce you to Git and GitHub. This presentation is for individuals with limited knowledge on Git and GitHub, although those with robust knowledge or background are more than welcome to join! 

# Learning objectives
1. Develop an understanding of what Git and GitHub are 
1. Install Git, GitHub and RStudio
1. Connect Git, GitHub and RStudio

## What is Git?
Have you ever tried working on a project or a specific piece of code with another teammate? Or have you ever overwritten your code and had to rewrite the chunk from the beginning?

Frustrating, right? Well, Git is a version control that allows you to do better. Be a better coder, communicator and person because the time you will save can then be spent elsewhere!

Now, I will preface by saying that there is a learning curve to Git. But keep at it, take breaks, and do not ignore your mental health.

* Working directory/tree: where you have one version of the project checked out
* Staging area, or "index": a file on what will go into your commit
* Git directory is where your metadata is. This is what is copied when you clone a repository from one computer to another.

## **Setup**

Let's get started shall we! 

First, check to see if you already have Git installed. On Windows, look for an application called "Git Bash" and on Macs, search for an application called "Terminal." Type "git version" into the terminal. If you have an output with the version, Git is installed, if you the terminal is saying unknown command, then Git it not installed. 

If you do not already have Git installed, navigate to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and click *Downloads.* Select the software appropriate for your system and follow the remaining installation steps.

**Windows**

1. Select **"Click here to download"** This should be the version you need however, you can look below to see additional options.
1. Allow installer to download then open.
1. "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to this device?" Yes, yes you do! You will need administrative access to your computer for this.
1. Use the defaults throughout the installation process.

**Mac**

If you have Git installed, then we will most likely just need to update it. 

To Update Git
1. Follow this [video](https://modulesunraveled.com/installing-git/updating-git-if-you-have-only-version-comes-xcode-or-command-line-developer-tools)!

To Install Git
1. Select **"Click here to download"** This should be the version you need however, you can look below to see additional options.
1. Click on the Binary installer link and select download.
1. Once it is downloaded, open the file, locate the package, right click and select "Open"
1. Follow the prompts

# GitHub
## What is GitHub?
Git and GitHub are essentially the same thing but GitHub makes it easier on us. GitHub is a management tool for your code. Think of it like Microsoft Word's tracked changes feature. In a Word document, you can use this feature to visualize the changes you or someone else are making. In GitHub, we are using a similar way to visualize version control. This is extremely important when you start working in teams or on a large project. You will want to have changes to your code saved so that you can refer back if you need to. 

## Setup
Navigate [here](https://desktop.github.com) to download GitHub Desktop and follow prompts

## Repositories
## GitHub Dictionary
Term      | Definition
--------- | ----------
Branching | When you duplicate part of a the repository
Merge     | After you finish updating the code you branched, you can merge it back into the project's main source code  

# RStudio
## Setup

**Checking Your Current Version of R**
```{r}
R.version.string
```

**Introducing Yourself to Git**
```{r}
#install if needed:
#install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "#insert your first and last name#", user.email = "#insert your email#") 
  #use.email should be the same as your GitHub account
```

**Setting up a token in RStudio**
```{r}
usethis::create_github_token()
gitcreds::gitcreds_set
```

## RStudio Resources

& that's it! 


## Sharing your tutorial
### Slides
If you're sharing your tutorial at an R-Ladies meeting, consider making slides to go along with it.

See the [R-Ladies Gainesville presentations repository](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/presentations) to download the the R Markdown file `tutorial_template.Rmd`. The tutorial_template presentation is created with the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) package and the RLadies theme by [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/project/rladies-xaringan/).

### Github
Now it's time to add your tutorial to the R-Ladies Gainesville [tutorials repository](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/tutorials). This will make it easier for others to provide feedback and for people to use your tutorial!
