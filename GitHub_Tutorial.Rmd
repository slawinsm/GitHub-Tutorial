Git.. GitHub.. What are they? Why do they matter? In this tutorial we will introduce you to Git and GitHub. This presentation is for individuals with limited knowledge on Git and GitHub, although those with robust knowledge or background are more than welcome to join! 

# Learning objectives
1. Develop an understanding of what Git and GitHub are 
1. Install Git, GitHub and RStudio
1. Connect Git, GitHub and RStudio

# Git
## What is Git?
Have you ever tried working on a project or a specific piece of code with another teammate? Or have you ever overwritten your  code and had to rewrite the chunk from the beginning?

Frustrating, right? Well, Git is software that allows you to do better. Be a better coder, communicator and person because the time you will save can then be spent elsewhere!

Now, I will preface by saying that there is a learning curve to Git. But keep at it, take breaks, and do not ignore your mental health.

* Working directory/tree: where you have one version of the project checked out
* Staging area, or "index": a file on what will go into your commit
* Git directory is where your metadata is. This is what is copied when you clone a repository from one computer to another.

## **Setup**

Let's get started shall we! 

First, check to see if you already have Git installed. On Windows, look for an application called "Git Bash" and on Macs, search for an application called "Terminal." Type "git version" into the terminal. If you have an output with the version, Git is installed, if you the terminal is saying unknown command, then Git it not installed. 


If you do not already have Git installed, navigate to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and click *Downloads.* Select the software appropriate for your system and follow the remaining installation steps.

**Windows**

1. Select **"Click here to download"** This should be the version you need however, you can look below to see additional options.
1. Allow installer to download then open.
1. "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to this device?" Yes, yes you do! You will need administrative access to your computer for this.
1. Use the defaults throughout the installation process.

**Checking Your Current Version of R**
```{r}
R.version.string
```

**Introducing Yourself to Git**
```{r}
#install if needed:
#install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Michelle Slawinski", user.email = "slawinsm@gmail.com") 
  #use.email should be the same as your GitHub account
```

**Setting up a token in RStudio**
```{r}
usethis::create_github_token()
gitcreds::gitcreds_set
```




## Information for reproducibility

R and R packages are continuously updated and examples that work under a certain set of conditions may not work under another set. Ideally, you would update your tutorial when key software is updated to maintain working examples. However, that may not be feasible, and the next best option is to provide learners with all the necessary information about your computing environment. This can help them identify differences with their computing environment that may be preventing the example from running as expected. 

**My computing environment:**

Session information
```{r}
sessionInfo()
```

RStudio version
```{r}
rstudioapi::versionInfo()$version
```


## Sharing your tutorial

### Slides
If you're sharing your tutorial at an R-Ladies meeting, consider making slides to go along with it.

See the [R-Ladies Gainesville presentations repository](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/presentations) to download the the R Markdown file `tutorial_template.Rmd`. The tutorial_template presentation is created with the [xaringan](https://slides.yihui.org/xaringan/#1) package and the RLadies theme by [Alison Hill](https://www.apreshill.com/project/rladies-xaringan/).

### Github

Now it's time to add your tutorial to the R-Ladies Gainesville [tutorials repository](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville/tutorials). This will make it easier for others to provide feedback and for people to use your tutorial!

If you do not use Github, email your `.Rmd` file to R-Ladies Gainesville at <gainesville@rladies.org>.
