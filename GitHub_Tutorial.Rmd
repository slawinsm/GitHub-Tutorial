Git.. GitHub.. What are they? Why do they matter? In this tutorial we will introduce you to Git and GitHub. This presentation is for individuals with limited knowledge on Git and GitHub, although those with robust knowledge or background are more than welcome to join! 

# Learning objectives
1. Develop an understanding of what Git and GitHub are 
1. Install Git, and GitHub
1. Connect Git and RStudio
1. Create a profile repository
1. Do your first branching, commit, and push

# Git
## What is Git?
Have you ever tried working on a project or a specific piece of code with another teammate? Or have you ever overwritten your code and had to rewrite the chunk from the beginning?

Frustrating, right? Well, Git is a version control that allows you to do better. Be a better coder, communicator and person because the time you will save can then be spent elsewhere!

Now, I will preface by saying that there is a learning curve to Git. But keep at it, take breaks, and do not ignore your mental health.

**Setup**

Let's get started shall we! 

First, check to see if you already have Git installed. On Windows, look for an application called "Git Bash" and on Macs, search for an application called "Terminal." Type "git version" into the terminal. If you have an output with the version, Git is installed, if you the terminal is saying unknown command, then Git it not installed. 

If you do not already have Git installed, navigate to [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and click *Downloads.* Select the software appropriate for your system and follow the remaining installation steps.

**Windows**

1. Select **"Click here to download"** This should be the version you need however, you can look below to see additional options.
1. Allow installer to download then open.
1. "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to this device?" Yes, yes you do! You will need administrative access to your computer for this.
1. Use the defaults throughout the installation process.

![2. Select Components](C:/Users/slawinskimc/OneDrive - Florida Department of Health/Documents/GitHub/GitHub-Tutorial/Set Up Images/2. Select Components.PNG "2. Select Components")

**Mac**

If you have Git installed, then we will most likely just need to update it. 

To Update Git
1. Follow this [video](https://modulesunraveled.com/installing-git/updating-git-if-you-have-only-version-comes-xcode-or-command-line-developer-tools)!

To Install Git
1. Select **"Click here to download"** This should be the version you need however, you can look below to see additional options.
1. Click on the Binary installer link and select download.
1. Once it is downloaded, open the file, locate the package, right click and select "Open"
1. Follow the prompts

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
## What are GUIs?
Git but better. GUIs are where you can use Git but in a more visually pleasing manner. 

**Popular GUIs**
Microsoft       | Mac            
---------       | ----------     
*GitHub Desktop | *GitHub Desktop 
*GitKraken      | *GitKraken
*Sourcetree     | *Sourcetree
*TortoiseGit    | *Fork
*SmartGit       | 

```{r concepts, echo=FALSE}
install.packages(pander)
mytable = data.frame(Microsoft/Mac = c("
                                   \\\n 
                                   \\\n * GitHub Desktop
                                   \\\n * GitKraken
                                   \\\n * Sourcetree
                                   \\\n * TortoiseGit
                                   \\\n * SmartGit"))
```

# GitHub
## What is GitHub?
Git and GitHub are essentially the same thing but GitHub makes it easier on us as human beings. GitHub is a cloud based management tool for your code. Think of it like Microsoft Word's tracked changes feature. In a Word document, you can use this feature to visualize the changes you or someone else are making. In GitHub, we are using a similar way to visualize version control. This is extremely important when you start working in teams or on a large project. You will want to have changes to your code saved so that you can refer back if you need to. 

## Setup
Navigate [here](https://desktop.github.com) to download GitHub Desktop and follow prompts

#Let's Practice!
We will be practicing how to branch of a repository from GitHub, make a change locally, and then commit those changes and push them back to GitHub. Ready? No? Well here we go anyway! Lets get our feet wet. 
1. Navigate to [RLadies of Gainesville's GitHub](https://github.com/R-Ladies-Gainesville) 
2. Locate the "practice" repository

#Additional Learning in R
# RStudio
## Setup

**Checking Your Current Version of R**
```{r}
R.version.string
```

**Introducing Yourself to Git**
```{r}
#install if needed:
#install.packages("usethis")

library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "#insert your first and last name#", user.email = "#insert your email#") 
  #use.email should be the same as your GitHub account
```

**Setting up a token in RStudio**
```{r}
usethis::create_github_token()
gitcreds::gitcreds_set
```

## RStudio Resources

& that's it! 

#Last Minute Things
##Tips
1. Update some basic profile features GitHub offers like a picture, occupation, or location! Click your picture in the top right corner after logging in and select 'Settings.' 
1. You can also personalize your profile's ReadMe file with an introduction for people who will visit your page. This is again optional but helps you get noticed. If you want to see some super cool examples, beef up your profile with certain tools, or do some  late night reading on how to make your profile stand out, look at this [repository](https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/awesome-github-profile-readme)!
1. Make sure you have a ReadMe file for every respository. This serves as an executive summary for your project and saves viewers time on figuring out what the purpose of your project is.
1. Branch this markdown file and add your own tips!

## Dictionary
Term           | Definition

Staged/Indexed | Marked a modified file to go into your next commit snapshot
Commit         | Save the state of your project in your local system
Push           | Once you commit your project or file to your local system, you have the option to push it to GitHub
Branching      | When you duplicate part of a the repository
Merge         | After you finish updating the code you branched, you can merge it back into the project's main source code

# Sharing your tutorial
